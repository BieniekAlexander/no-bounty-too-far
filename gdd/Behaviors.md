# Goals and Related Actions
- As a matter of priority, I would say the goals are:
	1) ensure safety
	2) fulfill objectives

| Goal       | Actions                             | Signals                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safety     | Get away from threats if vulnerable | Who/what is a threat?                                   |
|            | Arm oneself                         | Maybe hunt for a weapon if you can't find one           |
| Objectives | Eliminate threats                   | Who is a target?                                        |
|            | Make money                          | Bribe NPCs?                                             |
|            | Other                               | Maybe particular characters have particular motivations |
- Interactions:
	- different NPCs will be threatened by different things
		- maybe some NPCs won't consider you a threat
		- maybe some NPCs will be impervious to certain things (e.g. electricity) so their safety is different from the mechanics of your own safety, for example
	- different NPCs will have different motivations (maybe by faction, employment, etc.)
		- some will want to kill you
		- some will want to help you

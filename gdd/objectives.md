# Introduction
An overview of the emotional experience that I'm trying to create with this project. I'll frame these points around the [8 Kinds of Fun Framework](https://www.riotgames.com/en/urf-academy/fun-and-feeling) that I came across, as described by Riot Games.
# Overview
With this project, I'd like to make a top-down stealth game with roguelike elements. Core to the design shall be:
- low power level of the player, making objective completion a puzzle to be solved
- Resource management, conserving what one has, looking for more, and take calculated risks to be rewarded
- Emergent systems, comprised of smaller interactions and resulting in the puzzles that comprise stealth experiences
- As a roguelike game, I'd like for the player's power to slowly increase over time until a mistake ends their whole run
Narratively, I have the following so far:
- You play as a bounty hunter, starting with little-to-no resources and collect money through contracts, allowing you to buy things to increase your power level and take on harder contracts
- You play in a high-scifi, intergalactic setting, where you come across characters of different factions, species, technology levels, etc., providing for various systems to interact with and challenges to tackle
- You're given options of contracts to take, which will bring you to different environments and face different enemies. Completion of the contracts will reward you with money, but will also dynamically update the state of the world, providing for a narrative that you play through throughout your run:
	- Maybe you complete a contract for a group of people, who are then more inclined to give you more contracts in the future
	- Maybe a mission has you assassinate a target, which leads people to increase their security in the relevant region
	- Maybe you get caught using a particular type of weapon, leading enemies to adapt and anticipate your using it in the future
# Experiences
-  Sensation
	- *I'll let this develop as I progress with developing aesthetic assets.*
- Fellowship
	- *At present, I only have plans for a single-player experience, so I'll skip over this point.*
- Challenge

- Fantasy
	- I want to pursue the power fantasy of macgyvering your way through challenges, which is the big draw to stealth games for me.
	- Pertaining to rogue-likes, I'd also like for the player's power level to increase over time.
- Narrative
	- Existence of different factions and agentic information gathering should provide for emergent story-telling.
- Discovery
	- With procedural generation of a rogue-like world, hopefully each playthrough feels uniquely interesting - see Dwarf Fortress.
	- Resource scarcity will hopefully provide for more rewarding looting. A key thing to figure out will be how to balance:
		- unique equipment that will make their differences feel exciting
		- A low enough power level to items that will prevent a given item or loadout to work like a silver bullet for all situations.
- Expression
	- Expression requires that there's more than one way to approach a problem. Whereas most puzzle games have a single solution, more open-ended games provide for a myriad of approaches to problems.
	- At the same time, I'll need for challenges to be constrained such that you can't muscle your way through a challenge just by using good technical skill or collecting a good loadout. Constraining a player's resources should constrain the ways that a player can approach a situation, which forces them to be creative.
- Submission
	- To my own regret, I think the game should have little technical challenge. Timing windows should be really manageable, and it should be pretty rare that players are pressed to execute something, unless they brought it upon themselves (e.g. they're getting chased because they messed up).
	- I also really want the game to be playable on mobile devices, because I think there's quite a lack of compelling games to be played on mobile.

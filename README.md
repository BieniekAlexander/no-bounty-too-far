# Introduction
Yet another video game project that I'm starting, who knows if I'll finish it

# Initial Setup
- Download [Godot 4.5](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Get a copy of the `assets` folder (ask me for it) and put it into the root of the project
	- at present, I'm just using assets purchased from itch.io, so I don't own anything and therefore can't upload it

# Testing
Use [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) for unit testing when applicable.

# Roadmap
- See the Issues section for bugs and features to work on
- TODO make a game design document - thinking to use Quartz for it
